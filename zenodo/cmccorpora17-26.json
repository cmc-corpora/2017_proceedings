In a legal expertise it had been recommended that standard measures of anonymisation be applied to the corpus before it could be republished. This paper reports about the anonymisation campaign that was conducted for the corpus. Anonymisation has been realised as categorisation, and the taxonomy of anonymisation categories applied is introduced and the method of applying it to the TEI files is demonstrated. The results of the anonymisation campaign as well as issues of quality management are discussed. Finally, pseudonymisation as an alternative to categorisation is discussed in general as a method of the anonymisation of CMC data, as well as possibilities of a (partial) automatisation of the process.\n", "language": "eng", "title": "Anonymisation of the Dortmund Chat Corpus 2.1", "access_right": "open", "partof_title": "Proceedings of the 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmccorpora17)", "conference_place": "Bolzano, Italy", "keywords": ["corpora", "anonymisation"], "conference_url": "https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu", "conference_dates": "3-4 October 2017", "upload_type": "publication", "communities": [{"identifier": "cmccorpora17"}], "publication_date": "2017-09-30", "conference_title": "5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities", "creators": [{"affiliation": "Institute for the German Language, Germany", "name": "L\u00fcngen, Harald"}, {"affiliation": "University Duisburg-Essen, Germany", "name": "Bei\u00dfwenger, Michael"}, {"affiliation": "University of Mannheim, Germany", "name": "Herzberg, Laura"}, {"affiliation": "University Duisburg-Essen, Germany", "name": "Pichler, Cathrin"}], "publication_type": "conferencepaper", "conference_acronym": "cmccorpora17", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1040713", "relation": "isPartOf"}]}}
