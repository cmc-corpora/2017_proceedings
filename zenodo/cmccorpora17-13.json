First, we analyze the frequency of mentions for the demonyms for the inhabitants of the European and G8 countries. Then, we focus on the representation of demonyms for residents of Slovenia\u2019s neighboring countries: Austria, Italy, Hungary and Croatia. The main topic of the tweets mentioning Croatians, Austrians and Italians is sport, whereas Hungarians occur most often in relation to the Eurovision. Some economic and political issues are also represented, such as the selling of Slovene companies to foreign firms, the refugee crisis and the arbitration procedure between Slovenia and Croatia. A collocation analysis revealed a highly stereotypical treatment of the neighboring nations and hostility of some Slovene Twitter users to inhabitants of Slovenia\u2019s neighboring countries.\n", "language": "eng", "title": "Corpus-Based Analysis of Demonyms in Slovene Twitter", "access_right": "open", "partof_title": "Proceedings of the 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmccorpora17)", "conference_place": "Bolzano, Italy", "keywords": ["demonyms", "nationalities", "Twitter", "discourse analysis", "Slovene"], "conference_url": "https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu", "conference_dates": "3-4 October 2017", "upload_type": "publication", "communities": [{"identifier": "cmccorpora17"}], "publication_date": "2017-09-30", "conference_title": "5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities", "creators": [{"affiliation": "Faculty of Arts - University of Ljubljana, Slovenia", "name": "Kuzman, Taja"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Arts - University of Ljubljana, Slovenia", "name": "Darja Fi\u0161er"}], "publication_type": "conferencepaper", "conference_acronym": "cmccorpora17", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1040713", "relation": "isPartOf"}]}}
