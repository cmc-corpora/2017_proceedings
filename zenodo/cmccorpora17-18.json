Particularly, the transparency of a form aimed at gathering information about the pedagogical context of oral telecollaboration for language learning named Teletandem (TT; Telles, 2006) will be tested before it is spread more widely. To uncover problems in submitting information, data-input-triggers quality and reliability have been tested interviewing professors and language instructors who will be involved in a preliminary phase of Teletandem corpus implementation. General goals of the study are to enlarge the research group, to increase data and to improve efficiency in data collection.\n", "language": "eng", "title": "Developing a protocol for collecting data in Higher Education: assessing natural language metadata for a Databank of Oral Teletandem Interactions", "access_right": "open", "partof_title": "Proceedings of the 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmccorpora17)", "conference_place": "Bolzano, Italy", "keywords": ["corpora", "data collection", "metadata", "telecollaboration", "language learning", "protocol for data collection"], "conference_url": "https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu", "conference_dates": "3-4 October 2017", "upload_type": "publication", "communities": [{"identifier": "cmccorpora17"}], "publication_date": "2017-09-30", "conference_title": "5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities", "creators": [{"affiliation": "Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Italy", "name": "Leone, Paola"}], "publication_type": "conferencepaper", "conference_acronym": "cmccorpora17", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1040713", "relation": "isPartOf"}]}}
