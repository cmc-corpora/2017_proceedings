Spoken conversations have a high score on dimension 2, while CM conversations show register and regional variation on dimension 1 and 3. FB groups are significantly different in both regional varieties, followed by FB status, comments and tweets. Pakistani FB groups discuss self-help related topics, and appear to be slightly interactive and highly informational, while the US ones are interactive and narrative discussing community and political issues. Pakistani FB status and tweets use English mainly for informational purposes, while the US counterparts have interactive and personal orientation indicating a wider functional role of English.\n", "language": "eng", "title": "A Comparative Study of Computer-mediated and Spoken Conversations from Pakistani and U.S. English using Multidimensional Analysis", "access_right": "open", "partof_title": "Proceedings of the 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmccorpora17)", "conference_place": "Bolzano, Italy", "keywords": ["register variation", "multidimensional analysis", "World Englishes", "conversations"], "conference_url": "https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu", "conference_dates": "3-4 October 2017", "upload_type": "publication", "communities": [{"identifier": "cmccorpora17"}], "publication_date": "2017-09-30", "conference_title": "5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities", "creators": [{"affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Germany", "name": "Shakir, Muhammad"}, {"affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Germany", "name": "Deuber, Dagmar"}], "publication_type": "conferencepaper", "conference_acronym": "cmccorpora17", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1040713", "relation": "isPartOf"}]}}
