{"metadata": {"license": {"id": "CC-BY-4.0"}, "imprint_publisher": "cmc-corpora conference series", "description": "The paper reports on the results of a scientific colloquium dedicated to the creation of standards and best practices which are needed to facilitate the integration of language resources for CMC stemming from different origins and the linguistic analysis of CMC phenomena in different languages and genres. The key issue to be solved is that of interoperability \u2013 with respect to the structural representation of CMC genres, linguistic annotations metadata, and anonymization/pseudonymization schemas. The objective of the paper is to convince more projects to partake in a discussion about standards for CMC corpora and for the creation of a CMC corpus infrastructure across languages and genres. In view of the broad range of corpus projects which are currently underway all over Europe, there is a great window of opportunity for the creation of standards in a bottom-up approach.\n", "language": "eng", "title": "Connecting Resources: Which Issues Have to be Solved to Integrate CMC Corpora from Heterogeneous Sources and for Different Languages?", "access_right": "open", "partof_title": "Proceedings of the 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmccorpora17)", "conference_place": "Bolzano, Italy", "keywords": ["corpora", "research infrastructures", "annotation", "anonymisation"], "conference_url": "https://cmc-corpora2017.eurac.edu", "conference_dates": "3-4 October 2017", "upload_type": "publication", "communities": [{"identifier": "cmccorpora17"}], "publication_date": "2017-09-30", "conference_title": "5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities", "creators": [{"affiliation": "University Duisburg-Essen, Germany", "name": "Bei\u00dfwenger, Michael"}, {"affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Clermont Auvergne, France", "name": "Wigham, Ciara"}, {"affiliation": "ICAR Laboratory Lyon, France", "name": "Etienne, Carole"}, {"affiliation": "Justus-Liebig-Universit\u00e4t Gie\u00dfen, Germany", "name": "Grumt Su\u00e1rez, Holger"}, {"affiliation": "University of Mannheim, Germany", "name": "Herzberg, Laura"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Arts - University of Ljubljana, Slovenia", "name": "Darja Fi\u0161er"}, {"affiliation": "Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Germany", "name": "Hinrichs, Erhard"}, {"affiliation": "University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany", "name": "Horsmann, Tobias"}, {"affiliation": "Justus-Liebig-Universit\u00e4t Gie\u00dfen, Germany", "name": "Karlova-Bourbonus, Natali"}, {"affiliation": "Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, Germany", "name": "Lemnitzer, Lothar"}, {"affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, France", "name": "Longhi, Julien"}, {"affiliation": "Institute for the German Language, Germany", "name": "L\u00fcngen, Harald"}, {"affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Toulouse 2, France", "name": "Ho-Dac, Lydia-Mai"}, {"affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Nanterre, France", "name": "Parisse, Christophe"}, {"affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Nice C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, France", "name": "Poudat, C\u00e9line"}, {"affiliation": "Institute for the German Language, Germany", "name": "Schmidt, Thomas"}, {"affiliation": "Eurac Research, Italy", "name": "Stemle, Egon W."}, {"affiliation": "University of Mannheim, Germany", "name": "Storrer, Angelika"}, {"affiliation": "University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany", "name": "Zesch, Torsten"}], "publication_type": "conferencepaper", "conference_acronym": "cmccorpora17", "related_identifiers": [{"identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.1040713", "relation": "isPartOf"}]}}
